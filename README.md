Black Jack game for Comp-426 Final

Hi! This is just a quick guide for my web page. This is a Black Jack game, but with a few modifications to betting and hand calculations, but the essential gameplay of Black Jack is unchanged.

If you need a guide on how to play Black Jack, this is a brief summary
Black Jack is a game of chance but with skills.
The goal is to beat the House's hand value, while also maintaining that your hand is below or equal to 21. Hand value is calculated by adding the value of the cards in the hand.
There are only 2 special cases: Jack, Queen and King is counted as 10; Aces are wildcards, they can be 1 or 11.
When you start the game, there are four options to take. These are:
- Hit
- Stand
- Double Down
- Split
The game works as follow: You have to begin by making a bet. This will be subtracted from your starting pot. Then you choose one of the four options:
- If you Hit, one more card is dealt to your hand. You can keep hitting until you Stand or go Bust - over 21.
- If you Stand, the round ends and your hand value is compared to the dealer.
- if you Double Down, you double your bet and Hit one card then Stand.
- If your initial hand has two card of same values, they can be Split into two hands.
The House must draw if below 17. If your hand is greater you get your bet back plus the bet sum to the pot 
- Black Jacks hands, (21 value) can be with any number of cards, and the rewards is greater (1.5 * bet)

Thank you have have fun!
